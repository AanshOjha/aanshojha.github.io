# ðŸš€ GitHub Pages Deployment Status

âœ… **Your portfolio is connected and ready!** All fixes have been pushed to GitHub.

## âš¡ Current Status

- âœ… Repository: `https://github.com/AanshOjha` (connected)
- âœ… Build workflow: Fixed and deployed
- âœ… All conflicting workflows: Removed

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Step: Configure GitHub Pages

**Right now, you need to:**

1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/AanshOjha`
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")
5. Save the settings

## ðŸ”„ About the "Canceling" Error

The error you saw is **normal**:
- Multiple commits triggered multiple deployments
- GitHub cancels older deployments to deploy the latest version
- Only the newest deployment will complete successfully

## âœ… Check Deployment Status

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository: `https://github.com/AanshOjha/actions`
2. Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. The latest run should complete successfully (green checkmark, ~2-5 minutes)
4. Your site will be live at: `https://AanshOjha.github.io/`

## ðŸ”§ Fixed Issue: Base Path Mismatch

The blank page was caused by a case-sensitive URL mismatch:
- Repository name: `Portfolio` (capital P)
- Base path was: `/portfolio/` (lowercase p)
- **Fixed**: Updated base path to `/` to match repository name

## ðŸŽ‰ Your Portfolio Will Be Live!

Once deployed, your portfolio will be automatically updated whenever you push changes to the main branch.

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Update content** in `src/lib/data.ts` with your real information
2. **Add your resume** to the `static` folder as `resume.pdf`
3. **Add project images** to showcase your work
4. **Customize colors** in `tailwind.config.js` if desired

## Troubleshooting

- **404 Error**: Wait a few minutes after first deployment
- **Styling Issues**: Check if all CSS is loading properly
- **Build Failures**: Check the Actions tab for error details

Your portfolio is production-ready! ðŸš€
